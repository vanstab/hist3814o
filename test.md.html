So in the artical about <a href="http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html">Open Notebook History</a> a classmate (<a href="https://hypothes.is/users/csamuelson">csamualson</a>) made comment about having all your notes publicly available. It got me thinking about how protective I can be over project that I’m working on myself. As for the reaseach notes I sometimes struggle to related to it. I don’t usually have lots of reasearch in my field that I spend hours upon hours looking for and putting it together to write something on. A lot of the time I spend looking from someone that can explain something and happly share these reasorces to anyone who asks. However when it comes to code and my person work al of a sudden I’m not keen on letting others seen it. I want to keep all my work hidden, either worried about someone critiquing it before its done, or someone taking from it without giving credit. If i was to have it publically available though people could learn from what I did and be able to do something new! I always complain that I want to change things so maybe I can start by making what I do more public</p>
