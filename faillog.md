Ok so for this time through I didn't really "Fail" going through module one except when I tried running a command in the linix shell with the ‘$’ still part of the string. Also I’m adding this file late as I really felt like I need to mention something
The reason I don’t have a “Fail” doing the stuff in module one is only because I went through that phase before with linix and github in my first year of computer science. Both I tried using and both I failed to use then. Also, Github I might not use the windows app still as I just can’t seem to get all of it to work seamlessly. Oddly enough though I don’t mind using it in visual studio where I have been working on my honors project.
However, when reading about Github module Dr. Grahams wrote I realise when using Github I need to utilise more of the features like branching! Let’s just say reading Dr. Graham’s comment on making a branch made me feel like I “failed” as I have gone on many branches in my honours project. Only to go back to the original work not saving the work I had done in my branch. Then of course I think latter on “oh I should have kept that work just in case I was doing something right……”
